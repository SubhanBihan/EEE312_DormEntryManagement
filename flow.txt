Each person has 10 ID and 10 Name samples.
For profile building keep 6 samples of ID and 6 samples of NAME of each person in tran_ids and train_names respectivley.
The rest 4 samples of ID and 4 samples of NAME of each person in test_ids and test_names respectivley.

for VQ matrix extraction:

vqvq.m ---> project_mfcc.m --->(inside project_mfcc) ----> pre_emphasis.m 
---> silence_remover.m ---> framing.m ---> use my_fft.m for fourier transform
---> take MEL filter from mel_bank.m ---> get MFCC coeffs ---> delta.m ---> return to vqvq.m ----> vqsplit.m ----> save VQ matrices

same for ID and name speech samples.
VQ matrix extraction for speech samples done.
This is profile building for the people who will be included in our databse.
The samples are taken from tran_ids and train_names folder

Now for testing, we do same extraction for speech from test_ids and test_names folder.

FOr live testing: go to vqlivetest.m
take a test speech sample by live recording ----> pre_emphasis.m ---> silence_remover.m ---> framing.m ---> use my_fft.m for fourier transform
---> take MEL filter from mel_bank.m ---> get MFCC coeffs ---> my_dist.m ---> disteu.m
